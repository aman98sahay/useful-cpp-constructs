# useful-cpp-constructs

have created this library for keeping useful cpp constructs that I have to write everytime I go to do something , 
this will serve as a ready reference to me. 

hope being that this will help me be more productive, and not waste time writing same thing again and again.

(example PrintLinkedList function and CreatingLLFromNumber )
